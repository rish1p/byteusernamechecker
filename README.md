Byte Username Checker

I take no responsibility for this, feel free to use it as you wish. Credits to @4-W for some of the source. I highly recommend using repl.it and uploading your files to it if you are not familiar with Python. 

Just copy all the usernames you would like checked to usernames.txt, and the program will output them in available.txt
